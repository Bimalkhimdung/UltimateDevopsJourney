## DATA Types
This is a Day-2 of complete python course for my Ultimate Devops Journey Course.

- what is data type ?
    Data type simply identification of which type of data is stored by a variable.
    for example. 
    ```
        a=5
        print(type(a))
        gives output as 
        <class int>
    ```
**Standard Data Types**
1. Numbers [^1]
    -  Interger
    -  Complex Numbers.
    -  Float
2. Sequence Type
    - String
    - List
    - Tuple
3. Boolean
4. Set
5. Dictionary
### Numbers
[^1]: Numbers
Numeric values are stored in numbers. The whole number, float, and complex qualities have a place with a Python Numbers datatype. Python offers the type() function to determine a variable's data type.
    
```
     print(type(variable))  
```
## Sequence Type
### String
- The sequence of characters in the quotation marks can be used to describe the string.
- A string can be defined in Python using single, double, or triple quotes.

    ``` 
    str = "string using double quotes"  
    print(str)
    ```

        - method means functions that what can we do with this object
    - Data
        - data means that data which related to object.
## what is class ?
- Class is a blueprint of objects or we can say a template
- eg. if we want to build a building we first create complete Map of build, like this if we want to create a object then we first create template and we use them as like as a template similar to function.
## __init__ function
It's used for automatically call function without creating calling function 
## __str__ function
It's the function that tells python whenever someone tries to print that object print in this format instead.
## class properties
    are the variable inside class 
## class method
    are the functions inside class

## self Parameter
- It reference to the current instance of the class and used to access variables that belongs to the class

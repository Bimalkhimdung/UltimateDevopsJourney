## why oops ?
- give more security over functions
## Objects
-  It has two main Property 
    - Method 
        - method means functions that what can we do with this object
    - Data
        - data means that data which related to object.
## what is class ?
- Class is a blueprint of objects or we can say a template
- eg. if we want to build a building we first create complete Map of build, like this if we want to create a object then we first create template and we use them as like as a template similar to function.
